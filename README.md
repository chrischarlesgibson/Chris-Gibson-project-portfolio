## Description

---

Chris Gibson's project portfolio is a the main webpage for Chris Gibson's portfolio, bio and contact info. ([Link to project found here](https://chrischarlesgibson.github.io/Chris-Gibson-project-portfolio/)). This webpage was made in order so that potential enployers can review samples of my work in order to determine if I will be a good candidate for them. It also serves as a directory to my linkedin,spotify, email info, phone info and Github reporsitories so that employers can connect with me and review all my repositories.

- built up HTML and CSS from scratch
- added recent photo along with bio
- added links to my github, linkedin and spotify profiles
- included responsive layout that adapts to viewport
