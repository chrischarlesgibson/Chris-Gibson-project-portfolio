# Chris Gibson's project portfolio

## Description

---

Chris Gibson's project portfolio is a the main webpage for Chris Gibson's portfolio, bio and contact info. ([Link to project found here]()). This webpage was made in order so that potential enployers can review samples of my work in order to determine if I will be a good candidate for them. It also serves as a directory to my linkedin,spotify, email info, phone info and Github reporsitories so that employers can connect with me and review all my repositories.

- built up HTML and CSS from scratch
- added recent photo along with bio
- added links to my github, linkedin and spotify profiles
- included responsive layout that adapts to viewport

Example of refactored code with added semmantic elements and comments:

```
<!--added more descriptive title-->
    <title>Horiseon Marketing Agency</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!--modified Div to be header tag because header is a semantic element-->
    <header>
      <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
      <!--modified Div to be nav tag because the below link needs to be on a navigation bar-->
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
          </li>

```

## Usage
